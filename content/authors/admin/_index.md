I am a Marie-Curie [Fellini Fellow](https://web.infn.it/fellini/) in the cosmology group at the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare [INFN](https://www.pd.infn.it/eng/), Sezione di [Padova](http://active.pd.infn.it/g4/), under the supervision of [Sabino Matarrese](http://unipd.academia.edu/SabinoMatarrese). My main research interests include theories of gravity and physics of the early universe. I refereed articles for the [Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1475-7516), [European Physical Journal C](https://epjc.epj.org), the [International Journal of Modern Physics D](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/ijmpd) and the [Physics of the Dark Universe](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/physics-of-the-dark-universe). I am a topic editor for the [Universe](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/universe) Journal. Also, I co-coordinated courses of General Relativity and of Cosmology at master level.

I did my doctor course at the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics [YITP](https://www.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en-GB/), Kyoto University, under the supervision of [Misao Sasaki](http://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~misao.sasaki/). My first postdoc was at the Institute for Theoretical Physics [ITP](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de), Heidelberg university, under the supervision of [Christof Wetterich](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~wetterich/).

My work is supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 754496.
