The [Cosmic Microwave Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) (CMB) is a relic radiation coming from the early universe. The story for such radiation is as follows. The universe in its primeval stages was made of a very hot plasma of matter (photons and baryons),[^1] where photons could not travel much without interacting with electrons. As the universe expanded, the temperature dropped and the mean free path of photons increased. At some point, the photons completely escaped from the electrons and propagated freely. This is called the last scattering surface and these photons are what we observe! Actually, we see a snapshot of the physics of that early period of time. Thus, the CMB tells us about what was going on prior to the last scattering surface. Quite remarkably, the CMB radiation arrives at us at the same temperature (homogeneous) in all directions (isotropic). This confirms the cosmological assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on very large distances. 

Now the question is: what generated initially such a homogeneous and isotropic universe?


[^1]: We know that because Einstein's theory of gravity ([general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_general_relativity)) predicts that the universe expanded until its current size. This means that looking backwards in the past the universe shrinks and, as it becomes smaller and smaller, the temperature rises.
