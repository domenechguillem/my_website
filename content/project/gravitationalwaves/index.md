[Gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave) are the new window to observe the universe. They are clean source of information, as they barely interact with matter. [LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave) detected gravitational waves coming from the merger of binary black holes and binary neutron stars but these are not the only detectable sources of gravitational waves.

Gravitational waves may have also been generated from quantum fluctuations during [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)), [cosmic strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_string) and phase transitions in the early universe, when the energy scale was extremely high. Now, due to the large number of unresolved sources in our universe, these signals will appear as a [Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave_background)  (see this [review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04268) on the cosmological sources). I am interested in exploring cosmological sources of the gravitational wave background and the information that can be extracted about the history of our universe. 

Interestingly, gravitational waves generated out of quantum fluctuations during inflation also leave an imprint in the [Cosmic Microwave Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) as B-mode[^1] polarization of the radiation we receive (check my works on inflation and CMB [here]({{<ref "/project/newphysicsCMB/index.md">}})). I study technical aspects of the theoretical formulation of gravitational waves in cosmology.


[^1]: B-mode refers to the curl like pattern that only gravitational waves (and lensing) leaves in the CMB.
