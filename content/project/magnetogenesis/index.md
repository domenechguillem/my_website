It seems that magnetic fields are present even in the space between galaxies and they are coherent (not randomly distributed) within a Mpc (Megaparsec[^1]). A lower bound (the minimum value that the magnetic field should have) has been derived by observing [blazars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar). Long story short, a blazar is an extremely bright galactic center that is throwing a relativistic jet directly at us.[^2] This very high energetic relativistic beam of gamma rays interacts with extragalactic background light and creates electron-positron pairs. Now, if no magnetic field were present, such pair would annihilate again to produce secondary beams of gamma rays. Instead, if there are magnetic fields in the extragalactic space, the electron and the positron, once created, would go their separate ways and never annihilate back to a photon. It looks like this is what is happening! Check the original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.3504.pdf).

If these Mpc wavelength magnetic fields are present in the intergalactic space, what could have created them? Magnetic fields originated from processes within galaxies would not have had enough time to go that far (a Mpc is about three million light years!). I study the generation of magnetic fields in the primordial universe, during a period called [inflation]({{<ref "/project/newphysicsCMB/index.md">}}). The main problem of this (relatively old) idea is that in order to explain the magnitude of current magnetic fields, they had to be *huge* in the early universe (as the universe expanded and keeps expanding everything dilutes); so huge that they are not compatible with our current knowledge. I proposed one way to avoid this issue [here]({{<ref "/publication/magnetogenesis/index.md">}}).

Another interesting phenomena that would occur if such huge electromagnetic fields were present in the primordial universe is what is known as the [Schwinger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_effect). Electromagnetic fields are so strong that particle-antiparticle pairs can be created out of the vacuum consuming the energy of the electromagnetic field. This effect is particularly interesting if the universe is expanding. I have provided intuitive explanations [here]({{<ref "/publication/schwinger/index.md">}}).

[^1]: Mega = a million times. [Parsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec) (pc) = 3.3 light years. A pc is the typical separation between stars. Roughly 10 kpc (kiloparsec) is the typical length of a galaxy. Mpc is the typical separation between galaxies.
[^2]: More properly, a blazar is an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with a relativistic jet that is pointing towards us. This is why it appears extremely bright.
